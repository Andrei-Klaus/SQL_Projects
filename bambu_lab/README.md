# Bambu Lab Store Database

This project is a practice database simulating a 3D printing store ecosystem.  
It includes tables, relationships, stored procedures, and sample data.  
Focus areas: database schema design, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, and controlled data insertion using procedures.  
The database is self-contained and ready for querying and further practice.
