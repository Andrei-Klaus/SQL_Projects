# SQL_Projects

A collection of SQL practice projects demonstrating my skills in relational database design, data manipulation, and query development.  

Each project includes:
- Database schema with tables, keys, and relationships
- Stored procedures for controlled data insertion
- Sample data for testing and querying
- Optional queries or notes to demonstrate practical usage

Projects in this repository:
